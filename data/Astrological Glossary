Elevating harmonies that build upon a stable triadic foundation, leading to a soaring, inspirational climax.																							
23	Minor Grand Trine	A small, harmonious aspect pattern involving a trine and two sextiles, offering talent and creative potential with less intensity than a Grand Trine.	Delicate, intricate harp or piano pieces that weave subtle harmonies into a gentle, pleasing whole.
